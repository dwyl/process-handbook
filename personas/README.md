# How to Create Personas

Personas remind us who 
the **people** using our product are 
and what pain points they have. <br />
They help avoid building an infinte feature list
for no specific person
where useability
is an afterthought: <br />

## Why?

Personas help us picture and _empathise_ with 
the _people_ using our product.
Personas provide a clear definition 
of the _person_ using the product, 
rather than a nebulous "user". 
Personas remind the team of the
*motives*, *pain points* and reasons *why* 
people _need_ a particular feature. 
Keeping these reasons at the forefront of the teams' mind 
can significanty impact the delivery of the product.

## What?

A persona is _usually_<sup>1</sup> a fictional character 
created to represent the type of person 
that is using the product in a particular way. 
The format in which they are written can vary
according to the needs of the project.
This tutorial will focus on 
["proto personas"](http://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-executive-alignment).
Proto personas are ideal for projects 
that are short on time / resources
but still want the core benefits 
that using personas offers.

Here's an example of a persona for a site 
([ClubSoda](https://github.com/club-soda/club-soda-guide)) 
that helps people find non / low alcohol drinks options 
and the venues that serve them. 
The context of the persona 
is around her background with alcohol 
and her balance of drinking:

![Persona, Nisha the Consumer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004041-d5933300-c0a9-11e8-9c97-c7ea0ad38d9e.png "Persona, Nisha the Consumer")

## Who?

_Anyone_ can create personas;
it's not exclusive to the "Product Manager/Owner" or "UX Designer".
In fact if you have _any_ role in a small team,
taking the _initiative_ to create personas
is a great way of showing leadership.
Even _solo_ entrepreneurs building products (Websites/Apps/Games/etc.)
can benefit _immensely_ from having personas.
They are a way of _focussing_ our attention 
on the _human being_ whose problem we are solving
and not getting distracted 
building shiny features nobody _asked_ for!
As you will see from our template + instructions below,
it's incredibly easy to create a persona in less than 5 minutes.
There's really no excuse _not_ to do it. 

<br />

## When?

#### "_The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now_" ~ Chinese proverb

Obviously the _best_ time to create personas 
is at the _start_ of a project
so that it's immediately clear to everyone 
_exactly_ who your are building it for.
The second best tiem to create personas is _right now_!
It doesn't _matter_ that you've never used them before
in your project/team/company. 
Start _today_ with _one_ persona. 
Don't use not having "time" or a printer 
as an excuse to not do it. 
It only takes 5 minutes 
and the benefits are _instant_.
Clarity of _who_ you are building "Feature X" for
and exactly what problem it solves for them.


<br />


## How?

A persona should include:

+ **Name, Category & Photo** — names that are an alliteration 
with the group that they represent are useful 
e.g. "Sophie, the Student". 
Accompany this with a photo or illustration of them.
+ **Age** (_don't be afraid to be specific_)
+ **Job Title & Organisation/Company** (_where applicable_)
if the person is not employed, 
e.g. "Full Time Dad" or "Keen Gardener", that's fine too.
Just try and be specific about their main "activity".
+ **Background** - the persona represents
a type of person using the product, 
think about what core background characteristics 
or attributes might be typical for this kind of person. 
You may be able to recognise these types from UX research
interviews you've conducted.
+ **Motivation** - **Why** do they need your product?
  What problem(s) can your product solve for them?
  Why would using your product benefit them?
+ **Pain points** - What do they struggle with at the moment 
in the domain of your product? 
What problems could you solve for them (even if it's not
currently being addressed by the product)? 
Is there anything that might put them _off_ of using your product?

Once you've created your cards 
you should print them and display them 
on the wall near your team. 
<!-- TODO: show printed personas on wall @dwyl/home -->
This means the team has easy access to remind themselves of them.
We like to refer to the personas in our standups,
while writing stores and during sprint planning.
This is a great way of giving specific context 
for the purpose behind a particular feature.

Personas are also beneficial 
for introducing new team members or stakeholders.

Personas can be tailored to the unique needs and goals 
of your project according to what you see relevant. 
For example you might want to use a _quantifiable_ pain
points scale:

![levels-of-pain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/45924741-3f230e00-beff-11e8-8d6d-c97f5ca8a11f.png)

### _Examples_

Here are some more examples of personas 
from the project to help people find low or no alcohol drinks 
and the venues that serve them. 
These personas are for the drinks brands, 
venue managers and the staff from the organisation behind the site.
They consider their involvement and presence on the site 
and how it can benefit them.
The first two personas are fictional representations 
of the two types of people using the App,
whereas the last persona 
([Jussi](https://github.com/jussi-club-soda))
is a _real_ person who is one of the admins of the App:

![Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004238-49354000-c0aa-11e8-801b-858d137f6b1b.png "Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager")
![Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004426-cb256900-c0aa-11e8-8faa-31878125a4d4.png "Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager")
![Persona, Jussi from Club Soda](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004730-7c2c0380-c0ab-11e8-96b1-267bdc416001.png "Persona, Jussi from Club Soda")

These personas and illustrations were created by
[Cleo](https://github.com/Cleop) 
a multi-talented Developer and scrum master. <br />
If you lack the drawing skills
or just want an _easy_ way to create your own personas,
you're in luck! (_keep scrolling_!)


## _Instructions_ to Make Your Own!

Once you have the _data_ (_facts, background & pain points_) 
required to create the persona,
it will take you _less_ than 5 minutes 
to create it using our template.

### 1. _Clone_ this Repo

Clone the GitHub repository that has the template you want to edit:

```
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/process-handbook.git && cd process-handbook/personas
```

### 2. _Edit_ the Template


(_Optional_) 
If you want live-reloading while you are editing the template,
run the `live-server`:

```
npm i && npm start
```

That will automatically open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser
e.g:

![personas-template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/85922069-8a0e4a00-b878-11ea-9e29-2224651687c8.png)


Open the `index.html` file in your editor
and edit the persona template text.

![edit-the-template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/85922186-3cdea800-b879-11ea-856d-51f6cd877be2.png)



### 3. _Use_ the Persona!

Once you have edited the data in the persona template,
take a screenshot 
(see [take-a-screenshot.org](http://www.take-a-screenshot.org) 
if you don't know _how_)
and upload it to GitHub 
where you can share it with your team. 
e.g:

![mia-manyinterests](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/85927108-dd45c400-b89b-11ea-80b4-b7df93925ecf.png)

We are using these in our app, see: 
[/dwyl/app/issues/213](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/213#issuecomment-650531694)

<br />

### Photos / Images ?

You don't _need_ to have a picture for your persona,
but it definitely helps to _personify_ them 
and it doesn't have to take more than a couple of minutes
to get or _make_ one.

If you don't _aready_ have great drawing skills 
(_or the time/patience to learn_),
then Bitmoji 
[bitmoji.com](https://www.bitmoji.com)
is a great (***FREE***) way 
to create a _personalised_ avatar.

![bitmoji](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/85795717-a901c480-b730-11ea-912d-ec07fbcbcaa1.png)

The best way to use Bitmoji is to **`download`** the App
from the Apple App Store or Google Play store
and create the avatar on your phone.
There is also a Chrome extension 
if you prefer _not_ to download any apps.
Bare in mind that we are security/privacy concious
@dwyl and wouldn't recommend any app 
that we haven't checked, downloaded and used ourselves.
You can deniy all permissions on the App and it still works fine.
It won't have access to any of your personal data,
and you can **`delete`** it as soon as you've finished using it.
There is zero marginal cost to the creators of the App.

> **Note**: Yes, bitmoji is owned by 
[**Snap Inc.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) 
makers of 
[Snapchat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat) 
the App that sucks the attention
of America's teenagers ... 🙄 <br />
But you _anyone_ can _use_ Bitmoji to create 
personalised avatars and then **`delete`** the App
without giving _any_ personal information to Snap. 
Simply _ignore_ their request to "start by taking a selfie",
or "upload a photo of yourself". 
Just create your emoji based on the desired _attributes_
and then download the resulting "bitmoji"
along with any variations you want.

## Notes

<sup>1</sup>Personas are _usually_ fictional representations
of a typical person using a product. 
This is to avoid subject of the persona feeling self-concious.
However in the case where you are building a feature 
for a very specific person 
(_e.g. your "boss" if you're building a specific feature 
of an internal tool like a sales dashboard_)
the persona is very clearly a person we _know_
and can describe them precisely to help the team focus.
That is the case of this last persona 
([Jussi](https://github.com/jussi-club-soda))
who is a _real_ person we know and love.
Having a well defined persona 
for the _real_ person using the product
can be _even more_ useful than a fictional one.
We just need to be careful to only use people
who have given their consent to be personified.
