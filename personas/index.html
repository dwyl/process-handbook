        <p><strong>Age: </strong>26</p>
        <p><strong>Job: </strong>Investigative Journalist</p>
        <p><strong>Background: </strong>
          Mia loves researching and writing articles on hot button
          contemporary issues and always has multiple investigations
          on the go. <br />
          She doesn't keep regular work hours, often working late 
          into the evenings and weekends.
          She has a tight-knit family that she loves spending
          time with and she's a fan of art and modern design, all 
          of which she struggle to find time for without feeling
          overwhelmed.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> 
        Feels like she's always working, but her concentration is 
        dispersed across many topics and interruptions. This leaves
        her feeling overwhelmed and like she has no time for her 
        loved ones & interests.

        <p><strong>Pain Level:</strong>

        <p><strong>Needs:</strong>
          A clear view of everything she is working
