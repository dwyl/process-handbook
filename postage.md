# Postage

We occasionally have to courier important documents
from one country to another
given our remote-first approach and the regulatory
world's 'less than remote or digital' approaches.

Having said this, using courier services is not a regular occurrence for us
so a fair amount of time passes between uses.
In order to not have to continuously research the most accessible and
trust-worthy services every time this needs to be done, we have recorded
the services we have successfully used in the past below.

## Sender in Portugal

### Recipient in Portugal (Domestic)
So far, we have only used the Portuguese national mail service,
[CTT](https://www.ctt.pt/) to deliver documents and items domestically.

We did have one urgent courier delivery to arrange and we used DHL (see below)
due to a lack of other online booking options, but more should be researched.

### Recipient is International
When sending packages internationally, there are a number of options:
+ The national postal service, [CTT](https://www.ctt.pt/empresas/encomendas-e-correio/enviar/regras-e-cuidados-para-envios/envios-internacionais) - last
we checked, they were much more expensive than competitors for
international deliveries and there were multiple weight limitations
+ [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-pt/home.html) - Usually also very expensive
+ [GLS](https://gls-group.eu/PT/pt/home)
+ [EuroSender](https://www.eurosender.com/) - An aggregator of courier services
+ [DHL](https://www.dhl.pt/)

We found a couple of others, but they were almost impossible to book online.

_Note: We have not used [EuroSender](https://www.eurosender.com/) yet, but
intend to investigate this option when we next require courier services_.

#### DHL
We have only chosen to use **DHL Express** to date because we have needed to
send documents during [the coronavirus pandemic](https://covid19.who.int/)
and this service was the only one offering guaranteed courier
collection from our location when all 'parcel shops' were closed.

According to [their website](https://www.logistics.dhl/pt-pt/home/obter-um-orcamento.html),
sending non-express packages through DHL can only be done by contacting them
or having a commercial account already established.

To use **DHL Express** however, all you need to do is go to the following URL:
https://mydhl.express.dhl/pt/pt/shipment.html#/rate-and-quote
And follow the booking instructions - you will be able to book collection dates
and time windows as part of the process.
The process is simple and reliable.

## Sender in the UK

### Recipient in the UK (Domestic)
In the past we have used [Interparcel](https://uk.interparcel.com/) for this,
both cheaply and successfully.  
It's worth researching the international options given here too though, as
they also work well nationally in most cases.

The [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/) is also an option here for
smaller packages, but sometimes more expensive for very urgent deliveries.


### Recipient is International
When sending parcels internationally, we have used two different websites that
aggregate a number of courier partners:
+ https://www.parcelmonkey.co.uk/
+ https://www.parcel2go.com/

Depending on package sizes and weights, the best option varies from one to the
other, but we have used both successfully in the past.

***NOTE:*** _It is key that the parcels are very well padded as in our
experience, there is little care taken with them over long distances_.

## Parcels that can Only be sent to the USA
Certain parcels can only be sent to the US and there are a number of services
that will help you receive your package within the USA and then ship it to you
wherever you are in the world.

For this, the most 'well-known' service is undoubtedly https://www.shipito.com/en/.
However, they charge a subscription _and_ their courier pricing is quite high.

Whilst we have not used it personally, https://shop2ship.com/ has been highly
recommended to us by friends who have used it successfully in the past.
They have no subscription, considerably lower shipping charges and a very
accessible repackaging charge (should you wish to have multiple parcels
repackaged into one).

_Note: The parcels still ship from the US so you will still incur the regular
customs charges as normal._
