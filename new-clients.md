# New client setup

So you've won some work from a new client - good for you! :tada: But the work has only just begun (literally), my friend. 

This is a checklist of what we aim to have completed before we start working with any new client:

* [ ] Set up Google Drive folders
  * (This is still a WIP as it's not currently possible to duplicate entire folders on Drive)
  * Set up a folder to match the `.template` structure (hopefully we'll find a way to just dupe it)
    * Be careful to keep the `permissions` the same
  * Save all documents with financial/sensitive information in the `.private` folder
    * Proposal
    * Contract
    * Budget planner
* [ ] Create and sign contracts
  * Template contract is saved in the `Clients` folder. Unless there are non-standard terms, only pages 1, 9, and 10 should change
* [ ] Book initial workshop
  * This will be the responsibility of the client contact
  * Bear in mind that our standard terms are for the first invoice to be paid five days before the start of the sprint, so that can be raised and sent out immediately
* [ ] Set client details up on Xero for invoicing
  * `Xero > Contacts > Customers > Add customer`
  * You'll need their accounts contact email address at least
  * Other contacts can be copied in or not as they prefer
  * (You should also ask what information they need for their system, if they haven't already requested it.)
* [ ] Set up github (organisation, repo, permissions etc.)
  * First ensure the client creates an organisation on github, then either...
    * ... creates the project repository
    * ... provides a member of the dwyl team with enough permissions to create a project repo
    * For reference, you can send the client [this](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference) for reference
    * And a dwyler should also ensure they've been through the checklist [here](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing#minimum-requirements-for-a-new-repository)
* [ ] Set up gitter
  * Decide whether this will be a `dwyl` channel or coming from the client repo
